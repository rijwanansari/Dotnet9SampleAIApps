## Anomaly Detection in Server Logs with .NET 9 and ML.NET
Server logs are a treasure trove of information. They can tell you a lot about system performance, user activity, and potential issues. But it’s hard to find those issues manually. You have to look through logs, and it’s hard to do that for a lot of logs. That’s where anomaly detection comes in. Anomaly detection is a machine learning technique that can automatically find irregularities. With .NET 9 and ML.NET, Microsoft’s open-source machine learning framework, developers can build strong anomaly detection systems within the .NET ecosystem. In this article, we’ll look at what ML.NET can do and how to use it to detect problems in server logs with .NET 9, using a real-world example.
