## Predicting User Behavior in .NET 9 with ML.NET and SDCA Logistic Regression
Predicting how users will behave is important for making their experience better, getting them more involved, and helping the business grow. By using AI and ML.NET, .NET developers can create smart applications that predict what users will do, personalize recommendations, and improve the decision-making process.

In this article, we will build a system that predicts how users will behave using .NET 9 and ML.NET. We will:

- Learn ML.NET and why we need it.
- SDCA Logistic Regression and some use cases
- Train a machine learning model to predict user behavior.
- Build an ASP.NET Core Web API to make predictions.
- Create a Blazor frontend to visualize predictions.
- Deploy the application using Docker.
